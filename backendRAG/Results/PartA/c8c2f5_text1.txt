Title: THE ART OF SAYING HELLO  
Subtitle: THE DAILY HORIZON 15th October 2023. A new trend revives the charm of traditional greetings

Content:  
In a world dominated by text messages, emojis, and fleeting video calls, a subtle yet transformative movement is underway. It’s all about reconnecting with the simple, yet profound, act of saying hello. Across coffee shops, community centers, and even office spaces, the practice of exchanging heartfelt greetings is making a comeback, leaving many to ponder the power of a word often taken for granted.

"Hello." Short, sweet, and universal – it’s astonishing how much warmth and meaning can be contained in just five letters. The reinvention of this timeless greeting may seem trivial to some, but to others, it's sparking significant changes in how they view communication and human connection in the digital age.

Section: The Hello Movement  
Lisa Chan and John Cheng, the founders of The Hello Movement, launched their initiative earlier this year with the ambition of encouraging people to put down their devices and engage in meaningful face-to-face interactions. Their idea stemmed from observing how digital communication has overtaken physical greetings—whether at the local bakery or the bustling train station.

"We realized people were too lost in their phones to even say a simple hello to one another. It was disheartening to see how often a smile or greeting got replaced with a quick message or email," Lisa explains. With this realization, they began hosting "Hello Socials" in various locations around Hong Kong, where attendees were encouraged to connect, talk, and, of course, warmly greet each other.

These socials are held in inviting setups – think cozy tables adorned with handwritten conversation starters, warm lighting, and an atmosphere of unhurried conversation. Attendees range from college students looking to make new friends to retirees eager to reminisce with strangers.

Greeting someone face-to-face may feel like an ordinary activity, but John believes it’s anything but mundane. "The energy that transfers when you greet someone with a smile or a ‘hello’ is something you can’t replicate over text or email. It’s simple yet rich with emotion."

Section: The Psychology Behind a Greeting  
Dr. Elaine Wong, a behavioral psychologist, has been researching the profound effects of greetings on social bonds. "When we say hello with sincerity, it often sets the tone for a deeper connection," she says. "It’s not just an opening phrase; it’s a way of signaling openness, trust, and friendliness."

Elaine explains that sincere greetings activate specific neurological pathways that release dopamine, a neurotransmitter associated with feelings of happiness and pleasure. When paired with eye contact or a warm smile, the effects become amplified. "Greeting someone isn’t just beneficial for the person receiving the hello—it also boosts the well-being of the one delivering it."

Interestingly, Elaine’s research also sheds light on cultural differences in greetings. "In Hong Kong, quick nods often replace traditional verbal exchanges, but I’ve found many people yearn for the tactile warmth found in Western cultures—think handshakes, hugs, or even a friendly wave."

Section: Greetings as a Tool for Connection  
Lisa and John have woven the art of the greeting into their personal relationships, too. "At our socials, we introduce people with personal anecdotes attached to their names. For instance, we might say, ‘This is Emily. She’s a fantastic violinist and loves cats.’ That introduction breaks the ice and makes the hello more meaningful," John shares.

Attendee Angela Leung, 26, admits she used to avoid saying hello altogether. "I thought it wasn’t a big deal, just a waste of time. But ever since I attended one of The Hello Movement events, something shifted. Now I say hello to my colleagues every morning, and it’s improved how we work together. It’s amazing how small gestures like greetings can bring people closer."

Angela's sentiments are echoed by Mark Wong, a 35-year-old banker. "I used to be one of those people glued to my phone, barely acknowledging anyone. But a workshop on greetings taught me how powerful first impressions can be. I started greeting my clients with a firm handshake and a warm hello, and it’s had a noticeable impact on my professional relationships."

Section: Reviving Greetings in the Workplace  
Lisa and John see enormous potential for bringing the art of the greeting into office spaces. Their latest workshop, "Hello in Business," is tailored specifically for corporate environments. It demonstrates how a sincere hello can build trust among teams, break tension during meetings, and even lead to smoother negotiations.

"We start the workshops by asking everyone to introduce themselves with a hello and share one personal fact. You’d be amazed how that small exercise melts barriers and creates camaraderie," Lisa says.

Sarah Tang, an HR executive who attended the workshop, implemented the greeting practices in her office immediately. "Our morning team huddles used to feel very stiff, but now, we start every meeting with cheerful hellos. It’s made our workplace far more harmonious and productive."

Lisa emphasizes, "A hello doesn’t cost anything, yet its power to transform relationships—whether professional or personal—is immense."

Section: The Hello Challenge  
To promote the practice even further, Lisa and John introduced a challenge dubbed "Say 10 Hellos," encouraging participants to greet 10 strangers throughout their day. Participants shared how the challenge not only elevated their mood but also opened doors to fascinating conversations.

One participant, Justin Choi, recounts, "I greeted the street cleaner in my neighborhood one morning. He looked startled at first but eventually broke into the biggest smile. We ended up chatting for five minutes before I went to work. It was incredible."

Another participant, 18-year-old university student Emily Yip, said the challenge helped her overcome her introverted tendencies. "It wasn’t easy at first, but by the third hello, I realized people appreciated the effort. They responded more warmly than I imagined."

Section: Community and Family  
Outside of its social and professional benefits, Lisa and John highlight how the art of greeting can deepen familial bonds. "Some families don’t even say hello to one another anymore—they’re just glued to their phones," Lisa says. "We encourage parents to teach kids the importance of greeting each other to build respect and empathy within the family."

John recounts a touching experience from one social event. A father and his teenage daughter hadn’t exchanged a word in weeks due to unresolved tensions. During the event, the daughter mustered up the courage to say hello, and it paved the way for reconciliation. "It started with a simple greeting, but it blossomed into a meaningful conversation that transformed their relationship."

Section: A Timeless Gesture  
It might seem like the world has moved past the significance of saying hello, but Lisa and John believe that the act is timeless, transcending cultural barriers, age differences, and generational trends. "As much as technology progresses, humans have an innate need for connection. A hello bridges that gap."

The Hello Movement continues to grow, with plans to reach across Asia and beyond. From bustling cities to quiet villages, it seems that the word "hello" is once again finding its place in people's lives.
