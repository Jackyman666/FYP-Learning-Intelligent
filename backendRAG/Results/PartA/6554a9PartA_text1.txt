In a world where technology often dictates the pace and methods of learning, a unique school in the city is redefining the fundamentals of education. At Sage Roots Campus, the focus is neither on iPads nor on virtual reality headsets, but on renewed methodologies rooted in personal interaction, creative thinking, and tangible activities.

Section: Sage Roots Campus and Its Vision  
Just a year ago, Sage Roots Campus opened its doors with a mission to embrace the values of learning through natural curiosity, collaboration, and exploration. Founders Emma Powell, a former secondary school teacher, and Liam Chan, an education consultant, wanted to bridge the gap between what they observed in Hong Kong’s competitive education ecosystem and what they believed real learning could be.

The school is located in a converted warehouse, with open learning zones, cozy reading corners, and study pods that blend a homely atmosphere with academic potential. There’s a distinct lack of rigid desks and tablets. Instead, walls are lined with books, art supplies, and tactile learning tools, from science experiments in progress to group projects involving recycled materials.

"Don't misunderstand us; we aren’t against technology," Emma notes. "We understand the importance of digital literacy in today's world. But we want students to grow critical and inventive minds before they become overly reliant on screens for solutions."

This philosophy has struck a chord with parents across the city. Enrolment for the coming term has already surpassed projections. Students carry out experiments by touching, tasting, and discovering, all under the guidance of empathetic mentors rather than teachers rattling through content.

Section: Independent Projects and Teamwork Activities  
One of the stand-out aspects of Sage Roots Campus' curriculum is "My Story Project," an initiative where students aged eight to sixteen choose their own topic, research it, and present findings in creative formats ranging from storytelling to hands-on demonstrations. 

Ten-year-old Caroline has created a presentation on how rainwater can be filtered using natural materials like sand and rocks. Her display includes a mini waterfall she built using empty soda bottles, earning applause from her classmates and questions that made her rethink her initial hypotheses.

“I’m so proud of what I’ve created,” says Caroline. "More than that, I loved how my class asked me questions and made me see what I'd missed. I have so many ideas for improvement next time!" 

Teachers, or rather "mentors", as they call themselves, avoid providing outright answers. "We focus more on asking the right kind of questions. Why do you feel this method works? Have you looked at it a different way? It guides students towards lateral thinking,” explains mentor Daniel Lee.

In the afternoons, students rotate to collaborative activities like culinary arts, urban gardening, or even carpentry. In one corner of the campus, a group of students is restoring an old bicycle as part of their "Upcycle Challenge." A 13-year-old notes, “It’s satisfying to build something together. I always thought I was bad at team projects, but now I see planning who does what makes it easier and enjoyable.”

Section: Preparing Future Change-Makers  
Emma and Liam believe this approach fosters not just good students, but leaders and empathetic individuals. "Our generation faces global crises like climate change, inequality, and mental health epidemics," says Liam. "We see our responsibility as preparing young people to handle uncertainty and create solutions that don't yet exist."

As part of preparing for such challenges, the school includes a "Once Upon a Problem” activity where students act as citizens fixing hypothetical crises in specially crafted scenarios. In one class last week, students worked on addressing a severe drought in a fictional town. They developed creative solutions like setting up water-efficient gardens and implementing education campaigns, showcasing presentations to both peers and parents in a ‘town hall’ style round-up. 

“When my daughter explained about desalination during the town hall exercise, I was stunned," shares Sophia Wong, a parent. "She had researched it herself and explained it better than I ever could. Her passion was visible.”

Section: The Role of Play and Reflection  
Despite Sage Roots Campus's ambitious vision to create forward-thinking individuals, they emphasize play as much as problem-solving. "Play is not just for young children. A teenager learns just as much from recreational activities as a five-year-old," Emma explains.

Games such as card-based creative thinking exercises, mock debates on playful topics, and even “drama improvisation tasks” are peppered throughout the week. Students reflect on them at the end of each day, considering what they learned about themselves and the nuances of working with others.

"It's inspiring to see how students begin to notice patterns—like how some rely too much on accuracy while others take risks, and they balance each other out," adds Daniel. "Through play, students not only have fun but develop emotional intelligence."

Section: Fostering Parents’ Involvement  
While many modern schools are designed to minimize parental interference in educational practices, Sage Roots does the exact opposite. Parents are asked to collaborate and contribute their skills to the school's workshops and weekend projects.

"Initially, I wasn’t sure what I could offer," says Kelvin Chan, father of twelve-year-old Jamie. "But when I was invited to demonstrate woodworking techniques last weekend, I felt more connected to the school and other parents. Also, it’s fascinating how kids’ creative questions teach adults something new."

The school schedules "Family Saturdays," where students, parents, and even grandparents come together to work on themed challenges or attend practical classes like compost making or art journaling.

Section: Early Achievements and Future Plans  
Despite being less than two years old, Sage Roots Campus has caught the attention of the Education Bureau for its experimental curriculum and remarkable feedback from parents. Several well-known educators have visited to observe this combination of modern pastoral mentorship and hands-on, project-based learning.

"Our long-term dream is to share what we’ve learned here with other schools,” Liam offers. "We’re also planning to expand the campus garden and build a small observatory to deepen our science offerings.”

Yet, as far as parents and students are concerned, Sage Roots doesn't need to change much more for now. "We've finally found a school that allows students to be kids while preparing for adulthood,” says parent Michelle Cheng.

Sage Roots Campus, located in the North District, opens its doors weekdays between 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. Family Saturdays run on the second weekend of every month. Find out more at (852) 5558 1234 or visit www.sagerootscampus.hk.
