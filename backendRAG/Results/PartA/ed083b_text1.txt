Title: HELLO BEYOND THE SCREEN  
Subtitle: IN THE TECH AGE, CONNECTION TAKES AN OFFLINE TURN WITH "HELLO CAFÉ"  

Content:  
In a world increasingly defined by screens and digital notifications, a small café in the heart of Kowloon offers an unexpected change of pace—an opportunity to unplug, unwind, and say "hello" face-to-face. At Hello Café, patrons aren't glued to their phones or indulging in online battles; instead, they immerse themselves in in-person experiences, designed to rekindle the art of human connection.  

Section: The Concept of Hello Café  
Hello Café was founded by two entrepreneurial millennials, Raymond Lee and Iris Wong, who were inspired by their love of meaningful interactions. Launched just three months ago, their café incorporates the simplest, yet most profound, idea—greeting and connecting with others through curated engagement activities. “We believe the word ‘hello’ is magical. It’s where every relationship begins,” Raymond says.  

The café’s atmosphere is inviting and intimate, with wooden interiors, warm lighting, and comfortable spaces designed for dialogue and laughter. Shelves stocked with interactive kits, conversation prompts, and classic parlour games line the walls. Each table hosts a signature "Hello Starter Kit," which includes prompts for questions, themed trivia, or shared puzzles—just enough to encourage strangers or companions to strike up discussions.  

Patrons across Kowloon have increasingly embraced Hello Café for its innovative twist on leisure time. “In the wake of group chat apps and social media, we’ve lost the joy of real-life connections. I used to scroll endlessly but felt so disconnected. This place helped me rediscover conversations,” says café visitor Emily Chan, 28, who now frequents the café weekly with her friends.  

Section: Hello Café and Its Activities  
The hallmark of Hello Café’s appeal lies in its enriching slate of activities. Interactive icebreakers, co-operative games, and even storytelling sessions set the tone for magical moments of connectivity. Among their most popular offerings are word association games, situational challenges, and “connection circles,” where patrons exchange thoughts and stories through guided prompts.  

One shining star is the café’s exclusive "Hello Stories" kit, imported from Scandinavia. This storytelling activity invites each participant to craft a mini-narrative based on random thematic cards. “It teaches soft skills, such as empathy, listening, and expressive creativity,” Iris explains.  

On display shelves, Hello Café offers over 50 activity kits, ranging in price from HK$150 to HK$800. Whether for intimate dinner parties or interactive workshops, these kits promise just as much joy at home as they provide within the café’s cozy walls. Interestingly, these kits also serve as learning aids. Some parents have purchased the storytelling kits to teach their children vocabulary building and narrative skills outside school settings.  

Unlike digital entertainment, the curated games in Hello Café challenge patrons to focus and make thoughtful choices. Their options encourage personal connection instead of competition. "Technology may offer convenience, but it often bypasses clarity and emotion. Our café prefers activities where what counts most is how people engage," Iris shares.  

Section: Greetings That Break Ice  
One activity routinely spotlighted during coffee hours is "Hello and Tell." Café patrons are provided colour-coded cards that facilitate storytelling or the sharing of personal anecdotes. “It’s simple but deeply effective,” says frequent visitor Jason Wu, 25. “Over a single card, someone’s story intertwines with yours. It's not about winning—it's about connecting.”  

Another favorite is "Hello Maps," a game where players co-create a labyrinth inspired by each other’s aspirations or challenges. When completed, they share insights into their symbolic paths—offering a peek into one another’s worlds.  

The café has also collaborated with Hong Kong artists to create thematic conversation-based games designed exclusively for local audiences. These include the "Cultural Compass" card deck, which prompts patrons to discuss cherished elements of Hong Kong’s way of life—from its famous night markets to the neon-lit streets of Mong Kok.  

Section: A Tool for Learning Connections  
Besides serving as a nurturing space for leisurely gatherings, Hello Café doubles as a resource hub for teachers and organizations seeking interactive learning tools. Raymond and Iris occasionally host workshops to train educators on incorporating connection-based kits into classroom experiences.  

One avid advocate is Ling Tang, a primary school educator who uses Hello Café's "Empathy Training Game" with her students. “The game encourages pupils to understand perspectives, communicate openly, and resolve differences harmoniously,” she notes. Her classroom has seen a decrease in arguments and an increase in cooperative projects.  

David Chow, a social worker who visits Hello Café with teens living in youth shelters, praises the café’s resources for building interpersonal skills. “The word ‘hello’ signifies possibility. By starting with hello, these kids move forward—they imagine futures with supportive relationships formed through shared experiences,” he states.  

Even companies have discovered Hello Café’s offerings for team-building exercises. A recent corporate retreat held at the café highlighted "Hello Pathways," a board game challenging participants to empower their coworkers while navigating career hurdles. “These thought-provoking initiatives encourage organizations to foster better collaboration and reduce miscommunication,” claims Iris.  

Section: Patrons’ Reflections on Saying Hello  
The café’s popularity lies in its ability to carve out a communal environment where being present outweighs being perfect—a sentiment echoed by patron Sharon Leung, 19. “I enjoy Hello Café because there’s no need for pretense. You walk in as you are, say hello, and let the activities take you somewhere unexpected,” she remarks.  

“Modern life is isolating. I can email colleagues and rarely think about meeting them for tea. But Hello Café reshifts perspectives—you leave with deeper friendships or at least meaningful conversations,” says retiree Ken Wong, 63.  

Jonathan, who studies business management at university, says he learned surprising lessons about leadership at Hello Café. "Engaging in games makes you notice subtleties of decision-making and compromise. A simple puzzle-solving kit can simulate what running a project feels like!” he asserts.  

Others reflect on the café’s ability to foster genuine conversations that leave a lasting impression. Irene Lau, 35, likens her café visits to journeys back in time. "It reminds me of visiting relatives as a child—sitting for hours talking and telling riddles, sans distractions," she says nostalgically.  

Section: The Hello Philosophy  
Though technology continually progresses, Raymond insists that slowing down holds unmatched value.   “It’s easy to forget that saying hello is the oldest communication tool—older than smartphones. It leads to friendships, self-discovery, and a more connected life,” he says.  

In every way, Hello Café embodies its motto: “Start with hello and unlock connections beyond imagination.” Whether meeting old friends or strangers, embracing a shared moment can be transformative.
