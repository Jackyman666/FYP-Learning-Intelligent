Children, teenagers, and even adults, from countries such as India, Germany, Japan, Mexico, Kenya, the United States, and Brazil, are taking part by creatively exploring the cultural nuances of greetings. Participants craft “hi banners” using recycled materials as a way of saying hello and promoting unity in their communities."
