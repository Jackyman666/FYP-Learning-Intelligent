In an age of increasing digital detachment, people around the world are rediscovering the profound impact of a simple “hello.” This resurgence in interpersonal connection has taken shape through an international initiative called the Global Hello Campaign, which aims to encourage meaningful exchanges between individuals, starting with the act of greeting.  

The campaign encourages participants across multiple countries — including Japan, Brazil, Tanzania, Canada, India, France, and Singapore — to initiate greetings and conversations in various contexts as a way to bridge cultural and social divides. By exchanging “hello” in different languages, people are building a sense of community and shared humanity.

Last month, greetings flowed freely at a bustling café in Kyoto, Japan, where hundreds of people gathered to participate in a “Hello Marathon,” one of the campaign’s signature events. The Meeting Place, a cozy community café, served as the venue.  

The owner, Hiroshi Tanaka, envisioned the café as more than just a place to enjoy tea and snacks when he opened it in 2012. “I wanted something unique, where people could also nurture a sense of connection,” he said. “The word ‘hello’ is universal, and it felt like the perfect starting point to build that connection.”

The café’s involvement in the campaign began when Tanaka stumbled upon a video of the Global Hello Campaign on social media. The touching stories of strangers connecting with a simple greeting inspired him. “Greeting people, especially in public spaces, isn’t as common here as it used to be,” Tanaka observed. "This campaign reignites something deeply human.”  

The campaign’s ambassador, Maria Lee, explained, “We live in a time when we’re connected digitally but feel lonelier than ever. Just saying 'hello' can break down walls and remind us that we’re not so different after all.”  

The initiative urges participants to capture their greetings on postcards or through video messages and share them online using recycled or sustainable materials where possible. Lee explained, “We’re also encouraging individuals to write something personal beyond a ‘hello’, whether it’s a wish, a thought, or even a joke in their own language. These become tokens of positive exchange.”  

Last year, the campaign received 10,000 postcard submissions from across the globe to display in multiple cities. “It’s heartwarming to see how a simple act can ripple outward and inspire so much understanding,” said Lee.

One youth group from Mumbai decided to take part by hosting a language exchange workshop. Ten-year-old Aarav learned to say hello in ten different languages, including Swahili and Portuguese. “It feels like I’m a little global ambassador,” he said. Aarav’s classmate Priya, aged 12, wrote a letter in both Hindi and English to share as part of the campaign. “I included a story from my village and talked about what makes our community special,” Priya shared excitedly.  

Fourteen-year-old Jonas from France participated virtually by creating a video collage of online “hellos” shared within his gaming community. “I realized how easy it is to connect with people from very different places when you take the first step,” Jonas explained.  

Meanwhile, in Nairobi, seven-year-old Amina joined her neighbors in decorating handmade hello cards using traditional Kenyan beads and patterns. Her pledge to the campaign? To greet people outside her school every morning with a smile. “It makes me happy when people say 'hello' back,” Amina giggled.

Like quilting, the act of greeting has unexpectedly brought families closer as well. Preeti Patel, a grandmother in London, says she and her grandchildren bonded over writing postcards with “hello” written in Gujarati, English, and French. “It’s a small thing. But when you greet someone warmly, it’s a gift,” Patel explained.  

For retired teacher Linda Becker in Canada, the project rekindled her love of teaching languages: “My grandkids laughed when I taught them how to greet people in German by saying, ‘Guten Tag!’ But they’ve taken this to heart. They greet our neighbors every chance they get now, regardless of whether they know them.”  

Phyllis Long, a volunteer coordinator at a Tokyo nursing home, witnessed the campaign’s therapeutic effect first-hand. “Hello” postcards filled with drawings and greetings arrived from local schools, brightening the residents’ days. “Even those who rarely smiled became more responsive when a few ‘hellos’ came their way,” Long said.

“Hello” might be a small word, but its power is immense, according to the campaign’s ambassador Maria Lee. “It’s incredible to see how one exchange — this simple gesture — plants seeds for further kindness,” she commented. “It may not solve the world’s problems, but it reminds us of the human connection.”  

The campaign doesn’t stop here. Lee hinted at projects in the planning stages, which aim to deepen these connections. “Next year, we hope to launch programs focusing on shared storytelling and traditional greetings, so communities can amplify their cultural richness,” she revealed.  

The postcards and video messages collected during this year's initiative were displayed at exhibitions in key cities such as London, São Paulo, and Singapore. Attendees were encouraged to leave their own creative greetings at the exhibitions, making them dynamic and ever-growing spaces of exchange.  

Thanks to its blend of simplicity and international unity, the Global Hello Campaign has expanded beyond its original goals, reminding people everywhere that one word can change the course of a day — or even a relationship. Nevertheless, the campaign maintains an open invitation for people to just try it themselves, say that initial “hello,” and watch what happens.
