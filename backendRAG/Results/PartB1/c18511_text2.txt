Children around the world are finding their voices and sharing their stories in a unique way through Balala, an international initiative dedicated to nurturing creativity and encouraging self-expression among young people. With the help of this program, kids are writing, illustrating, and narrating tales that reflect their dreams, struggles, and cultural heritage.  

Balala originated in Kenya, named after the vibrant rhythm of traditional African storytelling evenings, where villagers would gather under the stars to weave stories about heroes, myths, and life’s lessons. Today, this initiative invites children from diverse countries, including India, Mexico, South Africa, the UK, China, Canada, and Australia, to participate by creating "story scrolls" — illustrated canvases depicting their unique narratives in a visual and textual format.

The heart of Balala lies in its centers like Balala Studio, a modest yet dynamic creative space in Nairobi, Kenya. At this converted warehouse, volunteers and coordinators worldwide work together to showcase the stunning array of story scrolls from children, coming together to form a single, vibrant mural—a gallery of dreams.  

Founded by Nairobi natives James Mwangi and his sister Anita, Balala Studio blends their passion for storytelling with their desire to elevate children’s voices. "Back when we started in 2005, the idea was simple: provide access to creative tools and a platform where young people could share their thoughts freely," says James. "We never imagined the global momentum Balala would gain, nor how impactful these stories would be."

It was Anita who first envisioned the cross-cultural reach of the initiative. "One afternoon, while attending a community meeting, I realized how universal storytelling truly is," she recalls. "I thought, what if every child had a chance to tell their tale—not just in villages, but everywhere? From bustling cities to remote communities, storytelling unites and inspires."  

Her first steps included partnering with schools and children’s organizations to spark interest and enlist young participants. Each child receives recycled paper, colored markers, and brushes to bring their ideas to life on a reusable canvas.  

Anita was particularly influenced by a landmark visit from Mira Patel, a Balala ambassador from India, who echoed a similar belief about the power of stories. "Stories are bridges between hearts," Mira shared. "Balala has given children in Mumbai's slums an outlet to share their dreams, their poetry, their struggles, and, yes, their beauty."  

Balala quickly began receiving thousands of contributions, from poetic entries written by aspiring authors to colorful scrolls created by budding artists. Last year, its center in Nairobi processed over 8,000 entries, 2,500 coming from international participants alone. On the walls of Balala Studio now hang murals that showcase scrolls from Peru to New Zealand, each one unique yet forming part of a cohesive tapestry.

A teacher in Johannesburg learned about the initiative through social media and immediately saw an opportunity for her students to contribute. Eleven-year-old Michaela shared a personal story about her grandmother’s courageous journey through apartheid. "One day, my grandmother stood bravely in front of a crowd…" begins her illustrated scroll, which blends simple yet powerful words with sketches of her community as her grandmother led it to hope.  

In China, eight-year-old Emily contributed her scroll entitled "My Wish Tree," combining colorful handprints with imaginative drawings of a tree filled with wishes from her classmates. While Emily’s classmates wished for things like "a pet puppy" or "making friends everywhere," her wish was touching: "I want to write books someday about kids who dream big."  

Similarly, in Canada, twelve-year-old Arman took a humorous route, penning a story scroll titled "The Tales of Balloon Hero." Despite whimsical characters shaped like balloons, Arman noted heartfelt themes of resilience and compassion.  

Parents, too, have praised Balala for the impact it leaves on their children. "I’d never seen my son Lars so motivated," said Sarah Johansson, whose seven-year-old contributed a story scroll last year in Sweden. "His story was about astronauts making bridges out of stars, which kind of reflects his love for problem-solving. Balala made him proud of his ideas, something every child deserves."  

Anne Rowley, a volunteer from Australia, finds the scrolls deeply moving. "I was sewing the scrolls for a mural, and then I got caught up reading them," she says. "It’s hard to stitch when you’re tearing up over such heartfelt messages from kids who see the world differently."

Balala’s founder, James Mwangi, underscores the initiative's purpose: empowerment through expression. "It’s vital that children understand their voices matter. Balala validates their ideas not just as stories, but as contributions to our global mosaic," he states.  

The stories and scrolls created through Balala have found homes in museums, schools, and even conferences designed to highlight the creativity of children worldwide. This year, one mural combining scrolls from 27 countries will travel to the United Nations headquarters in New York for International Children’s Day.  

What’s next for the initiative? James Mwangi has big plans. "We’re branching out to include digital storytelling. Kids can make virtual story scrolls, even short animations, and submit them via our online platform," he reveals. "We’ll use these tools to explore advanced themes like environmental justice, diversity, and peace-building."  

Through programs like Balala, children are reminded that their dreams and stories matter. As participants eagerly create new scrolls, their voices continue building a future shaped by positivity, creativity, and the collective spirit of storytelling.
