People around the world are coming together through a simple yet powerful act—the gesture of saying "hi." Across continents and cultures, greetings have evolved into an emblem of mutual understanding, respect, and connection. The Hi Campaign, an innovative global initiative, encourages individuals, especially young people, to embrace and explore the diversity of human interaction through language and gesture.  

Participants from countries such as the United States, Japan, Brazil, South Korea, India, France, Kenya, and others have been creating personalized greeting messages, expressing something unique about their culture or hopes for a harmonious global community. These messages are being compiled into a vibrant mosaic of greetings, which serves as both an artistic tribute to human connection and a mechanism to bridge cultural gaps.

Last month, a small cultural center in Toronto, Canada became the bustling hub for the Hi Campaign. Volunteers from across the city gathered there to curate and display hundreds of greeting submissions sent in from around the globe. Some participants submitted their greetings digitally, while others expressed themselves through handwritten notes, colorful drawings, or even video recordings.  

The cultural center, run by siblings Alex and Mia Rodriguez, has been fostering creativity and community interaction for over two decades. When they opened their space in 2002, their vision was to build a haven where locals and visitors could share ideas, learn about diverse cultures, and collaborate on artistic projects. The Hi Campaign perfectly fit their mission of promoting dialogue and global unity.

Mia first learned about the initiative from a podcast she stumbled upon during her morning jog. Intrigued by the campaign's simplicity and inclusivity, she immediately contacted its organizers to express her interest in hosting a local activity.  

The podcast featured long-time advocate Marcus Lee, who explained the premise of the Hi Campaign: “A greeting, no matter how small, can ripple outward to create change. It reminds us that our lives are interwoven, and communicating is the key to understanding each other. Whether it's a nod, a handshake, or the word ‘hello’ itself, we encourage participants to explore the greetings that matter to them.”  

Mia and Alex decided to dedicate their cultural center for an entire weekend, offering space, supplies, and even workshops for those who wanted to take part in the campaign. “We received around 600 greeting submissions from our local community, and over 3,000 internationally,” Mia explains. “It’s incredible to see such enthusiasm from people of every age, background, and culture.”  

Marcus Lee paid a visit to their center during the display. He was particularly touched by the creative ways people expressed themselves: some wrote phrases in their native tongues, while others shared symbols or objects representing greetings in their culture.  

Among the volunteers was Caroline Nguyen, a middle school teacher who brought her students to participate in a workshop. “Teaching my class about different cultures is a priority, and this project fit in perfectly. It was so heartwarming to see how eager the students were to reflect on how greetings connect people regardless of where they come from,” she said.

Caroline’s students created their greetings, showcasing ideas as diverse as their backgrounds. Twelve-year-old Liam illustrated a cheerful cartoon saying “Hola!” while his classmate Priya, age 11, turned inseparable words into art: “Namaste” appeared in a vibrant pattern of blues and yellows on her card.  

Liam explained his decision. “I chose ‘Hola’ because Spanish is such a happy language, and people usually smile when they say it!” Priya added, “Namaste means bowing to the divine in another person. It’s about respect, and I think the world needs more of that.”  

Thirteen-year-old Marissa opted for a modern twist, presenting her greeting through a mix of emojis and English phrases keeping it lighthearted. “A smiley face and a waving hand together mean the same thing as saying hi, don’t they?” she remarked.  

The campaign was also a family affair for the Martins. Rebecca Martin, along with her two children, created greetings inspired by daily moments. Rebecca’s five-year-old son Jaxon laughed and carefully scribbled “Hi, hi, hi!” in bright red crayon on his card. “He loves repeating everything three times,” Rebecca joked. Her teenage daughter Sofia created a more sophisticated piece, pairing the Italian word “Ciao” with an image of a handshake.  

“Even small interactions shape how we see people around us,” Sofia mentioned thoughtfully. “I hope this campaign reminds everyone to be kinder and open to strangers, whether it’s through a quick greeting or just a smile.”  

Another volunteer at the local center was Rachel Chen, a retired professor who offered her expertise on linguistics during one of the workshops. “It’s fascinating how greetings reflect cultural priorities. Some languages have greetings designed to inquire about one’s health, others emphasize the weather or current events. And yet, all these words share the same purpose—to bring people together.”  

Section: (E) Moving Forward  
Looking ahead, the Hi Campaign aims to empower communities across the globe. Marcus Lee believes that such initiatives provide a platform for connection where even children recognize the impact of small-scale changes. “It’s all about fostering a sense of belonging,” he shares. “Recognizing each other’s existence through something as simple as a greeting is not only heartwarming but transformative.  

Following this current campaign, organizers hope to launch a series of community-building projects that extend its outreach: discussions on cultural diversity, global exchange programs, and collaborative art installations inspired by greetings.  

The mosaic of greetings from the Hi Campaign will eventually travel to major cities across the world, displayed to celebrate International Friendship Day. Organizers are also hosting an online platform where visitors can contribute greetings digitally, share personal stories of how saying "hi" brought them closer with someone, and learn more about the significance of greetings in fostering global kindness.  

As Marcus Lee remarks, “At its heart, saying hello isn’t just about an exchange of pleasantries—it’s about acknowledging another’s presence, and celebrating the fact that no matter how different we are, we all have the ability to connect.”
