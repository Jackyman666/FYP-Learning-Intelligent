            "text": "Across the globe, people greet each other in countless ways — a wave, a smile, a bow, a handshake, and, often, with a single word: “Hi.” This simple greeting is more than an expression; it's a bridge between cultures, a way of forging connections, and an invitation to engage. In a world that often seems divided, the universal act of saying “Hi” serves as a reminder of our shared humanity."

Linguists theorize that it evolved from older forms of greetings like “Hail” or “Hey,” which were used in English in medieval times. Today, it's not only one of the most widely used words in casual conversation but also one of the simplest gestures of warmth, spanning countries, generations, and languages."
