In her findings, the act of greeting not only initiates interactions but also signals warmth, openness, and respect across different cultures and contexts."

            "text": "Readers may be surprised to learn how something as ordinary as a greeting can influence mental well-being and community dynamics. Harper shares moments of strangers bonding over a casual “hello” that led to collaborations, friendships, or even life-changing opportunities. She argues that neglecting this social custom may alienate individuals and create invisible barriers. Interestingly, her narrative seems a gentle nudge to rediscover how small efforts — like saying “hi” — can ripple into greater societal harmony."
