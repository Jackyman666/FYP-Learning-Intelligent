But paired with an excerpt from Dr. Elizabeth Carter's latest book, Beyond the Rankings: Rethinking Higher Education (Harper Academic, March), which challenges the traditional view of university prestige, the discourse has been nothing short of transformative."

            "text": "Carter's central goal is to critique the obsession with global university rankings and propose alternative metrics for evaluating higher education institutions. Drawing from decades of research and personal anecdotes as an academic and adviser, it is both a scholarly and personal narrative. She delves into the lives of her students, some of whom thrived at prestigious universities while others found success at lesser-known institutions, emphasizing factors like mentorship, community, and personal growth over numerical rankings."

            "text": "Readers may be surprised by Carter's candid dismissal of rankings as misleading indicators of quality. She argues that they often prioritize criteria that may not align with individual student needs, such as research output over teaching effectiveness. Instead, Carter champions a holistic approach, urging students to look at course content, campus culture, and post-graduation outcomes. Ironically, her work invites readers to reflect on the value of their educational choices and whether prestige truly equates to success."
