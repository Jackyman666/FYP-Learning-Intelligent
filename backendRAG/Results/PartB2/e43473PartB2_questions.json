A study conducted by Family Dynamics Research Group revealed that families who greet one another every day—either over breakfast or coming home from work—foster better emotional bonds than families who do not. “A simple hug or pressing hello reassures loved ones that they matter,” said Dr. Norris, lead author of the study. Rituals like these withstand the test of time. For grandparents and grandchildren, exchanging variations of 'hello' transcends generational gaps, reminding both parties of their shared history and love."

When Eliza moved from her quiet hometown to bustling New York City for work, she found understanding and adapting to greetings profoundly challenging. In Korea, greetings are often reserved and formal, steeped in respect for seniority or status. Eye contact is minimal, and bowing plays a central role. “In New York, everyone greeted so enthusiastically, even strangers,” she recalls. The cheerful “hey!” she received from cashiers and taxi drivers felt overwhelming at first. But over time, Eliza came to appreciate these informal exchanges as she built her own career away from home. “In Korea, greetings create boundaries; in America, they break them,” she observes, reflecting on cultural nuances behind this universal gesture."

With the rise of artificial intelligence and virtual assistants, we encounter greetings daily through gadgets.

While robotic responses may lack the warmth of human exchanges, tech companies continually refine voice tones to sound as welcoming as possible. Even as society debates whether AI lacks authenticity, one cannot deny the importance of initiating conversations—even with machines—on a positive note."
