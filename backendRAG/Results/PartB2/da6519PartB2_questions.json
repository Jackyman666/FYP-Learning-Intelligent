In the past, extended greetings were not uncommon; \"Good morrow!\" or \"Hail, friend!\" might have been the verbal currency among peers. Yet, just as modes of transportation became faster and lifestyles more urgent, greetings, too, became more direct. \"Hi\" fits seamlessly into this rapid dynamic—its short form echoes the urgency and efficiency required by the times."
