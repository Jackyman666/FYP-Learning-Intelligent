            "text": "The Wall Street Journal's provocative January 8 headline alone — 'Why Chinese Mothers Are Superior' — would have been enough to spark intense discussion. But coupled with an excerpt from Amy Chua's parenting memoir, Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother (Penguin Press, Jan.), that sharply contrasts so-called 'Eastern' and 'Western' styles of parenting, what resulted was nothing less than a firestorm."

            "text": "Chua's stated intent is to present the differences between Western and Chinese parenting styles by sharing experiences with her own children (now teenagers). It is a deeply personal story about her two daughters and how their lives are shaped by such demands as Chua's relentless insistence on straight A's and daily hours of mandatory music practice, even while vacationing with grandparents."

            "text": "Readers may be stunned by Chua's explanations of her hard-line style, public shaming and insults intended to force greatness from her girls. She insists that Western children are no happier than Chinese ones, and that her daughters are the envy of neighbors and friends, because of their poise and musical, athletic, and academic accomplishments. Ironically, this may be read as a cautionary tale that asks just what price should be paid for achievement."
