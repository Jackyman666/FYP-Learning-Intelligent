            "text": "In an earthen pit in central China, under what used to be their village's persimmon orchard, three middle-aged women are hunched over an ancient jigsaw puzzle. Yang Rongrong, a cheerful 57-year-old, turns over a jagged piece in her callused hands and fits it into the perfect spot. The other women laugh as if enjoying an afternoon amusement in their village near the city of Xi'an. What Yang and her friends are doing, in fact, is piecing together the 2,200-year-old mystery of the terra-cotta army, part of the celebrated (and still dimly understood) burial complex of China's first emperor, Qin Shi Huang Di."

            "text": "It usually takes Yang and her co-workers many days to transform a heap of clay fragments into a full-size warrior, but today they are lucky, accomplishing the task in a matter of hours. Yang has been solving such puzzles since 1974, when farmers from her village of Xiyang first unearthed pottery and a sculpted head while digging a well for their orchard. Having helped reassemble an army of a thousand warriors, Yang examines a clay head sheathed in 30 protective plastic layers. Visible through the wrap are flashes of pink and red, brilliant hues that hint at the original glory of the terra-cotta warriors."

            "text": "The monochrome figures that visitors to Xi'an's terra-cotta army museum see today actually began as the multicolored fantasy of a ruler whose grandiose ambitions extended beyond the mortal realm. The first emperor to unify China under a single dynasty, Qin Shi Huang Di packed a lot into his earthly reign, from 221 to 210 B.C. Aside from building the first lengths of the Great Wall, the tyrannical emperor standardized the nation's writing, reform system, currency, and measurements, and provided the source for the English word we now use for China (Qin is pronounced \"Chin\")."

            "text": "All the while, the emperor prepared for the afterlife, commanding the construction of the burial complex that covers 35 square miles. Qin's army of clay soldiers and horses was not a somber procession but a supernatural display of bold colors: red and green, purple and yellow. Sadly, most of the colors did not survive the crucible of time—or the exposure to air that comes with discovery and excavation. In earlier digs, archaeologists often watched helplessly as the warriors' colors disintegrated in the dry Xi'an air. One study showed that once exposed, the lacquer underneath the paint begins to curl after 15 seconds and flake off in just four minutes—vibrant pieces of history lost in the time it takes to boil an egg."

            "text": "Now, a combination of serendipity and new preservation techniques is revealing the terra-cotta army's true colors. A three-year excavation in Xi'an's most famous site, known as Pit 1, has yielded more than a hundred soldiers, some still adorned with painted features, including black hair, pink faces, and eyes. The best-preserved black or brown specimens were found at the bottom of the pit, where a layer of mud created by flooding acted as a sort of 2,000-year-long spa treatment."

            "text": "Almost thirty years ago, researchers started working with experts from the Conservation Office in Germany to develop a preservative known as PEG to help save the warriors' colors. During a recent excavation, the moment a painted artifact was unearthed, workers sprayed any bit of exposed color with the solution, then wrapped it in plastic to keep in the protective moisture. The most colorful pieces (and the earth surrounding them) have been removed to an onsite laboratory for further treatment. To everyone's delight, the modern techniques for preserving ancient colors seem to be working."

They are, in fact, clay quivers still bristling with bronze arrows. Shen and I skirt the remnants of a freshly excavated chariot, then stop beside a plastic sheet. \"Want to see a real find?\" he asks."

The wood has rotted away, but the shield's delicate design and brilliant reds, greens, and whites are imprinted on the earth. A few steps away is an intact military drum whose leather surface has left another glorious pattern on the dirt, its crimson lines as fine as human hair. Together with the imprints of finely woven silk and linen textiles also found here, these artifacts offer clues about the distinctive artistry that flourished under the Qin dynasty and the vibrant palette that infused it."

The next challenge, Rong says, will be to find an acceptable method for reapplying this color to the warriors."

            "text": "With less than one percent of the vast tomb complex excavated so far, it may take centuries to uncover all that remains hidden. But the pace of discovery is quickening. In 2011, the museum launched two long-term excavation projects on the flanks of the 250-foot-high central burial mound. Exploratory digs in this area a decade ago uncovered a group of terra-cotta acrobats and strong men. More extensive digs will yield mind-boggling excavations, which will amaze everyone, predicts Wu Yonggi, the museum's director."

Now, reflecting the evolution of the museum's views on historical accuracy, a new army is forming on the pit's west end, cracks and all. In every statue, Yang's handiwork is plainly visible. \"It's nothing special,\" she says with a modest smile. And with that, she and her village friends get back to work, piecing together the puzzle beneath the roots of their old persimmon trees."
